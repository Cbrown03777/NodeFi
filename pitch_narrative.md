# NodeFi Pitch Narrative

NodeFi is more than a staking service—it’s a strategic alliance between DeFi liquidity and PoS security. By channeling Uniswap V3/V4 trading fees and cross-chain yields into native validator networks on Solana and Ethereum, NodeFi unlocks a new dimension of yield for LPs and fortifies network decentralization.

1. **Fluid Liquidity → Real-World Security**  
   Every swap on Uniswap can now underwrite validator health, turning fees into stake.

2. **Aligned Alignment**  
   Lock NODE and UNI in veContracts to boost rewards—ensuring only committed, skin-in-the-game stakeholders govern the protocol.

3. **Self-Reinforcing Flywheel**  
   Trading fees → Validators → Yield → LPs → ve-locks → Governance → Deeper liquidity → Repeat.

Our ask: a Uniswap Foundation grant to build NodeFi, integrate with Uniswap pools, and launch this flywheel, delivering robust network security and market-leading yields in one integrated protocol.

Join us in transforming liquidity into security—NodeFi: where DeFi and PoS unite.
